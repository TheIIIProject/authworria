### How the "Authworria" name was coined
One day I came across a website called [vowlenu.com](https://vowlenu.com), It's a website that gives deep feelings, desires, concepts, and characteristics a word in English. 

Vowlenu's Definition of Authworria is "The growing anxiety while completing a story before its fast-approaching deadline."
