# Friends: Long-Distance Relationships(w.i.p)
"Hey Ray," Lethal speaks, "will you ever talk in the voice chat?". He looks at the text channel and waits as Ray types her message.
"One day..." Ray writes.
"We've known each other for almost 2 years now, ever since I met you during Fortnite Winter Royal 2019."
Back then I just signed up under the alias "Mrthersite". We had never met in real life but I had started communication with them through text. We talked about everything, They lived in the Netherlands and I lived in the UK, so I never expected us to meet in real life, but that didn't separate us, we kept talking and we hung out together and we've been friends to this day.
